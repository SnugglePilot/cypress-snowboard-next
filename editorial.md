## Today's Stoke Report

**Current Conditions (Feb 1, 2026):**

Today is a **skip**. Rain before 3pm and a mix of rain and a dusting of snow—not worth the drive. Lifts: 4/6 open. Snow (7 days): 11 cm. Base depth: 120 cm.

**Looking Ahead:**

The next good window starts **Thursday, Feb 5**. No rain before 3pm that day, and the forecast stays dry through Sunday (Feb 8)—that’s your best stretch. Monday (Feb 9) has rain in the AM again; then Tue–Thu (Feb 10–12) look clear. Plan around **Thu–Sun this week** or **Tue–Thu next week** for the cleanest windows.

_Stay frosty!_ 🏂
