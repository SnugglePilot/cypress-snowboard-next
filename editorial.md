**Today’s vibe:** *hard pass* unless you enjoy paying money to get misted like a grocery-store produce aisle.

We’ve got **0/6 lifts showing open** right now, and the forecast is basically yelling **“RAIN BEFORE 3PM”** with conviction (about **26.6mm** on the day, with only ~**2.2cm** of snow trying to cosplay as salvation). With a **120cm base** and **11cm over the last 7 days**, there’s enough snow *in theory*… but rain + warm temps is how you turn “winter” into “heavy mashed potatoes.”

**Looking ahead:** the first window that looks genuinely rideable is **Thu, Feb 5** (also **Fri, Feb 6**). Forecast rain drops to **0mm** and—critically—**no rain before 3pm**, which is the difference between “fun laps” and “sad, wet regret.” It may still be mild, so aim for early turns before the sun and warmth turn everything into slop.

**Big-picture snow nerd note:** BC’s automated stations were sitting around **127% of median** as of Jan 15 (South Coast up vs early Jan), but the commentary also flags a **warm/dry ridge** pattern—great for bluebird vibes, not great for preserving powder. Translation: grab the good days when they show up.

If you go today, you’re not snowboarding—you’re doing character development.
